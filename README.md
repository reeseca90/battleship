Battleship game

Development in progress:

currently the game creates a board and ships for a player when the playerFactory function is run, then allows the player to run shootEnemy, which checks with the gameBoardFactory object created under the player to see if something exists there (designated by a '1' in that coordinate of the array) and changes it to a 2 (if hit) or a 3 (if miss). 

need to designate a way to place specific ships and link it to the gameboard array

then make two players by default

then code game functionality
