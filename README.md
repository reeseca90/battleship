Battleship game

Development progress:

The game starts automatically, and randomly places ships for both the player and the AI. The game is played by clicking the 'AI Board' to select a location to shoot; hits are marked with red, and misses are marked with green. Immediately after the player move, the AI will generate a random coordinate pair, verify it has not used that pair yet, then shoots the player's board.

After sinking all ships (5), the game ends with a popup. The 'Start New Game' button refreshes the page, since that is the simplest way to reset all objects, DOM changes, and event listeners.

Potential future changes:
Option to play with to users, and ability to place own ships to go along with it
